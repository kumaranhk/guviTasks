What is meant by http and http request?
	HyperText Transfer Protocol(http) is a protocol which used for communication for the client and server. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web, and it is used for transmitting various types of data such as text, images, sound, video, and other multimedia files which have used in web pages.Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information. A typical HTTP request contains : HTTP version type, an URL, a HTTP method, HTTP request headers, Optional HTTP body. There are several versions in http. In this blog we goona see about the differenece between http 1.1 and http 2.
	
	For easy understanding lets assume your entering a url in your browser and hit the search button, when you click the search button there is a connenction made between your browser and server, this called TCP connection. It connection lost until you get all the response for that request.When you give another request or click any link in that loaded page, the TCP connection which made by the first request will block untill the first request get complete response whereas in http 2 one TCP connection is used for multiple http requests. In http 1.1 every request is on text format whereas in http 2 all the txets are covertd into binary format.
